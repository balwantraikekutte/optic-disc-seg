# optic-disc-seg
A Keras implementation of Optic Disc Segmentation

This the code for the solution that placed third in the preliminary (IDRID) optic disc segmentation challenge 

See subchallenge 3 (https://idrid.grand-challenge.org/Leaderboard/)

The task was solved using a residual variant of the Unet architecture, along with mean colour subtraction as preprocessing.
